  {
    Q: "What was the major geological process during the Paleozoic Era?",
    A: "Denudation, which reduced Precambrian mountain ranges to a peneplained surface.",
    Extra:
      "This process created undulating plains with some inselbergs, and sediments were transported to form continental and marine deposits.",
  },
  {
    Q: "Why are rocks from the Paleozoic Era rare in Ethiopia?",
    A: "Because of limited deposition during that era.",
    Extra:
      "Most sedimentation occurred in other regions, leaving little evidence in Ethiopia.",
  },
  {
    Q: "What significant process characterized the Mesozoic Era in Ethiopia?",
    A: "Epeirogenesis, or alternate sinking and rising of the landmass.",
    Extra:
      "This caused tilting of the land eastward, allowing sea invasions from the southeast.",
  },
  {
    Q: "What type of sediments were deposited during the Mesozoic sea invasions?",
    A: "Sand, mud (shale), gypsum, and lime.",
    Extra:
      "These sediments formed sandstone, shale, and limestone layers over time.",
  },
  {
    Q: "What are the three major sedimentary formations from the Mesozoic Era?",
    A: "Adigrat sandstone, Hintalo limestone, and Upper sandstone.",
    Extra:
      "These were laid on the Precambrian surface with transitional gypsum and shale layers.",
  },
  {
    Q: "Where are Mesozoic rocks most extensively found in Ethiopia?",
    A: "In the southeast lowlands and central Tigray.",
    Extra:
      "They are also exposed in the gorges of Abay and Wabishebelle rivers.",
  },
  {
    Q: "How does the thickness and age of Adigrat sandstone vary geographically?",
    A: "It is thicker and older in the southeast, decreasing northwestward.",
    Extra:
      "This variation reflects the direction of sea transgression and regression.",
  },
  {
    Q: "What is the economic significance of Mesozoic rocks in Ethiopia?",
    A: "They have potential for oil and gas deposits.",
    Extra:
      "The deposits are associated with marine life remains in limestone formations.",
  },
  {
    Q: "What caused the regression of the Mesozoic sea in Ethiopia?",
    A: "The slow rise of the land during the Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.",
    Extra:
      "This uplift led to the retreat of the sea and further sediment deposition.",
  },
  {
    Q: "What proportion of Ethiopia's landmass is covered by Mesozoic sedimentary rocks?",
    A: "25% of the country's landmass.",
    Extra:
      "These rocks often underlie Cenozoic deposits and surface in lowlands and gorges.",
  },
